<p> OS Lab 11 Summary <p> <br>
  Squid is a popular open-source proxy server software for Linux and other Unix-based systems. It acts as an intermediary between clients (such as web browsers) and servers (such as web servers), allowing clients to make requests for resources such as web pages or files, and caching the responses to improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage.

Squid proxy service provides various features and functionalities, including:

    Caching: Squid can cache frequently requested web pages, images, and other resources locally, so that subsequent requests for the same resources can be served from the cache, reducing the load on the original server and improving response times for clients.

    Access control: Squid allows administrators to define access control rules based on various criteria, such as IP addresses, domain names, or URLs, to restrict or permit access to specific resources or websites.

    Authentication: Squid supports authentication mechanisms such as Basic, Digest, and NTLM authentication, allowing administrators to require users to authenticate themselves before accessing certain resources or websites.

    Content filtering: Squid can be configured to filter content based on predefined rules, such as blocking access to certain websites or types of content, helping to enforce internet usage policies in an organization.

    SSL interception: Squid can intercept SSL/TLS connections, allowing administrators to decrypt and inspect encrypted traffic for security purposes, such as detecting and blocking malicious content or monitoring user activity.

    Reverse proxy: Squid can also be configured as a reverse proxy, where it receives requests from clients on behalf of backend servers, such as web servers, and forwards the requests to the appropriate backend server, allowing for load balancing, SSL termination, and other advanced configurations.

Squid is widely used in enterprise networks, ISPs, educational institutions, and other environments to improve performance, enhance security, and manage internet access. It is highly customizable and extensible, with a large community of users and developers contributing to its development and support.<br>
